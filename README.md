What:

I created a Developer portfolio webpage using the bootstrap grid and styling system.

Why:

To showcase my ability to make a mobile responsive webpage, and to provide a template for when I have more actual projects to showcase in my portfolio. 

How:

Using my current understanding of html, and the inclusion of bootstrap, I wrote the necessary code to display a easy to navigate webpage that is user friendly regardless of the device they are using to view it. I used the col/row system that bootstrap offers, and added the specific content that is relevant to me as a developer.

What I learned:

Through this process, I learned more about styling a web page, and how to make navigation easy and user friendly. I also learned how to display content effectively.
